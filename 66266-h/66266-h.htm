<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="nind"><big>T</big>HE Rose, for matchless beauty famed, (although by botanists so
disregarded) has been the Painter’s study and the Poet’s theme, for ages
past, and will no doubt for ages yet to come; long after many a curious
Nondescript shall in a dusty hortus siccus sleep, unnoticed and unknown.</p>

<p>The intention of the author in the delineation of this unrivalled tribe,
is to arrange as accurately as possible the numerous beautiful
varieties, with their species&mdash;an arduous task, considering the neglect
they have experienced, and the wild and indiscriminate manner in which
they have been profusely mixed. This, aided by an heterogeneous mode of
culture, has produced many varieties, the lineal descent of which is
very difficult to ascertain.</p>

<p>The extent of the genus has been most vaguely estimated; by some
enumerated at two hundred and forty; an estimate that must certainly
include many very slight varieties, which, if allowed, might swell the
genus to ten times its real extent. But we think a rational computation
would confine them within a hundred, including every distinct variety.
The author’s intention is to figure only those to which a separate
character can be affixed, regarding a superfluous repetition, even of
beauty, inadmissible. As the merits of the present undertaking may
easily be appreciated by a free access to all its beautiful originals,
the author hopes a candid allowance will be made, upon a comparison with
the living plant, when it is considered that the most elaborate efforts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span>of art have never yet been able to do justice to its superior beauty.</p>

<hr class="norm" />

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of this beautiful Rose, has ever been considered as enveloped
in obscurity; but we have no hesitation in assigning it to the Province,
to which it assimilates in every particular,&mdash;with the addition of a
rich luxuriant moss, that gives it a decided superiority, and at the
same time a specific distinction. In proof of our opinion, we have
recently seen both the Moss and Province Rose at one time, in high
perfection, on the same plant; and to remove all doubt, the plant was
dug up, to show that it was but one individual root. We have since seen
three more plants of the same description. Two of them had been
propagated by layers from the mossy shoots. The major part of them
returned to their origin, the Province. In the examination of a number
of Moss Roses, we have perceived a considerable difference in the
quantity of moss attached to them,&mdash;in many instances so slight, as
evidently to proclaim their original. There can be little if any doubt,
that this beautiful variety is the spontaneous effusion of Nature in
this country, of which we shall ever regard it as indigenous, since we
have never heard of any importations of this species, but of frequent
exportations. The most luxuriant specimens of this plant are the dwarf
growth in the open ground, from which our figure was taken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span></p>

<hr class="norm" />

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">To</span> the industry of Mr. Shailler, Nurseryman, of Little Chelsea, we are
indebted for this delicate new Moss Rose; an acknowledged production
between the Moss and White Province, or Rose Unique, and which is
certainly a valuable addition to this lovely tribe. It evidently bears
the compound characters of both plants, with a foliage very distinct
from either of them; yet it cannot be deemed perfectly a white flower,
since a delicate pale blush pervades the centre of the blossom: this,
however, we regard as no diminution of its beauty, and probably not a
permanent character, but owing to a tender habit, which time and culture
may remove, when it becomes more abundant.</p>

<p>At present it is a very scarce Rose, and requires a sheltered situation.
The soil in which most Roses thrive best is a light, sandy soil. Some
grow very luxuriant in a stony or gravelly situation. This succeeds
better with a considerable portion of rich bog earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span></p>

<hr class="norm" />

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> charming Striped Variety is another acquisition to the Mossy tribe,
and, we think, of equal value with the White; and though very distinct
in its character from that plant, it yet betrays a powerful affinity in
many particulars, so as to leave but little doubt of its origin being
nearly the same. In flower it approaches nearest to the York and
Lancaster Rose, which in size and colour it much resembles.</p>

<p>This is likewise the production of Mr. Shailler, who propagated it at
the same time as the White variety, and is equally scarce; principally
owing to its being treated with too little care before it was
sufficiently established. We have no doubt, however, that in time it
will be equally as hardy as any other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> species of Rose denominated Province, a native of Spain and Italy,
is by far the most extended. The varieties are so numerous, that they
apparently comprise one third of the genus. Our present figure
represents the Single Province, a very scarce rose; and as the incipient
ground of so many beautiful varieties, we regard it as peculiarly
valuable. It is a singular circumstance, that from Spain and Italy,
where the Province is supposed to be indigenous, and thence imported to
us, we should never have heard of the Single Province, much less
received the plant; which we can in no way account for, unless the
superior beauty of the Common Province, joined to its great abundance,
may have rendered the idea of importing those with single flowers
superfluous.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the recent additions to this genus, the White Province, or Rose
Unique, is indisputably the most valuable. Its introduction in 1777 was
entirely accidental, through the medium of the late Mr. Grimwood,
nurseryman, a great admirer and collector of roses, who, in an excursion
which he usually made every summer, in passing the front garden of Mr.
Richmond, a baker near Needham in Suffolk, there perceived the present
charming plant, where it had been placed by a carpenter who found it
near a hedge on the contiguous premises of a Dutch merchant, whose old
mansion he was repairing. Mr. Grimwood, requesting a little cutting of
it, received from Mr. Richmond the whole plant; when Mr. G., in return
for a plant so valuable, presented him with an elegant silver cup with
the Rose engraved upon it; and which in commemoration has furnished food
for many a convivial hour. It is of a dwarf growth, and remains in
flower near six weeks longer than the other Province Roses; which
renders it still the more estimable. We wish it had been in our power to
have accounted for its having been till so lately a stranger to us, and
whence indigenous; but at present our information is entirely confined
to the knowledge of its casual introduction; and until some further
light is thrown upon the subject, to elucidate its genealogy, we shall
regard it as a native.</p>

<p>Our drawing was taken from a plant in the nursery of Messrs. Colville,
King’s Road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span></p>

introduced by Mr. Kingston, nurseryman at Blandford near Dorset, in the
year 1791. In its character it has every thing in common with the
Province Rose, with a specifically distinct small flower (whence our
name); which contrasted with the largeness of its leaves, gives a
singularity to its appearance. In its blossom it approaches nearest to
the Roses of Burgundy and de Meaux; in shape like the former, but in
colour more resembling the latter: but no affinity whatever to the
leaves of either. It is certainly a very desirable Rose, as the number
of those with very small flowers is very circumscribed, and therefore
renders every addition particularly valuable. Like most of the Roses, it
continues to bloom during the months of June, July, and August, and
makes a handsome bushy appearance.</p>

very picturesque appearance. We observed but a slight proportion of the
rusty character so powerfully attached to the wild species. Its fruit,
when ripening, acquires a beautiful orange red, which is an addition to

particularly in phthisical cases. The flowers cannot be too quickly
dried, as slowly drying of them impairs both their colour and quality.
They are prepared as a conserve, by an infusion of honey. The bloom is
but of short duration, but the succession is rapid. It is of a
semi-double character, and of a fine red colour; from three to four feet
high, and very bushy. It is in great perfection during the months of
June, July, and August, and is extremely beautiful. Its foliage is
rather rough and coarse, and when out of bloom in the autumn it is very

although at times we have found it slightly scented, we must confess to
have found it sometimes so deficient in this particular as to be almost
induced to regard it as a scentless rose.</p>

<p>All the information that we have been able to acquire respecting its
introduction is, that it was first seen in the garden of the late Mr.
Parsons of Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, in the year 1793, soon after
which period Messrs. Colville procuring a plant, cultivated it, and it
has been ever since increasing in estimation. In the cold season of the
year its blossoms are very pale; too great an exposure to the sun
likewise produces the same effect. We have frequently seen it of a rich
flesh-colour, but never deep.</p>

<p>It is commonly called Pale China Rose; but we have preferred the literal
English name, to avoid confusion, by an appearance of two names for one

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> elegant Striped variety of the <i>Rosa Gallica</i> is certainly more
attractive than its original, the <i>officinalis</i>. Its fine red stripes
acquire a comparatively superior brilliance, by their contrast with the
white; from which analogous circumstance we believe the name of <i>Rosa
Mundi</i> has been originally derived from a collateral reference to that
celebrated lady in the reign of Henry the Second, commonly called Fair
Rosamund (signifying Rose-mouth). Thus, like the Rose, the colour of her
lips was heightened by the comparative delicacy of her fair complexion;
and which the Author has no doubt will be considered as a fair excuse,
however remote or questionable the etymology. Like all other variegated
Roses, an exactitude of character is never to be expected; we having
sometimes seen it more divided than our figure represents, and at others
so much less so as to be nearly one half white, and the other red.</p>

health or age of the plant. The leaves are invariably composed of
leaflets of from one to three pairs, with a terminating or end one: but
those having three pairs are mostly confined to the lower part of the
plant; and frequently those leaves at the base of the footstalks of the
flowers have only the abortive rudiments of what would have been one
pair of leaflets, had not the luxuriance of its blossoms absorbed the

be a permanent character, is certainly at present a matter of doubt; for
in several instances we have seen it lose this central distinction, and
attain the full height of its original. Yet against this observation we
are acquainted with two exceptions: one of them, a plant in the nursery
of Mr. Shailer; the other, a plant in the nursery of Messrs. Loddige;
neither of these plants having for years grown beyond a foot in height,

much more like the <i>nana minor</i>, or Pompone Rose; yet differing again
from that, in the great regularity of the petals&mdash;(whence the name
<i>æqualiflora</i>)&mdash;a trivial distinction, and yet the most prominent
feature allowed us by way of discrimination. Nor should we have adopted
it, had we not seen at the nursery of Messrs. Colville a number of
plants of exactly the same uniform description; which induced us to
regard it as a permanent character. If it should prove so (which time
alone can ascertain), the name will be sufficiently discriminative: but
in case the flowers should enlarge, that circumstance might probably
disorganize the symmetry of the petals, and it would then have no
distinguishing mark to separate it from the de Meaux; between which and
the Pompone Rose it is certainly a variety. But whilst so many
variations are allowed among the larger Roses, the lesser ones (but not
less estimated) may with propriety claim an equal right to be admitted,

Swedish Roses, claims it as a native of Sweden, finding great fault with
Linnæus for the inaccuracy of his description in confounding the
<i>pimpinellæfolia</i> with the <i>spinosissima</i>; an error, we have little
doubt, originating merely from having two names for one individual
plant. There are two slight variations from this plant: the one rather a
taller plant, whose flowers and leaves are of a more luxuriant growth;
the other and most material is one, said to be of recent importation
from Holland, whose leaves are narrower, nor are the spines quite so
numerous or perfectly straight as on the true <i>spinosissima</i>, but yet it
is evidently the same plant. This slight variation of clime and culture,
it is not at all improbable, might be the cause of the above confusion:
we have so frequently seen it growing wild on the waste lands within ten
miles of London, that, although it may be a native of Sweden, it
nevertheless seems quite at home in Britain. The single flower beneath
represents what is called a Striped Variety; but it is often so nearly
white, that, until its character is more determined, we shall decline a
separate figure. It is very hardy, of a lively appearance, but no great

the most immediate direction to any object we may be in search of. It is
an early-blooming Rose with single-flowers of the finest purple colour;

it may literally be said to creep upon the ground; and which may be
rather considered as an addition to the appearance of the plant, by the
relief its small white blossoms experience, contrasted with the sombre
earth on which they are spread. The duration of the bloom is much longer

immediately pointed out the specific title of multiflora, by which

of its petals, occasionally bursting at the sides, and destroying the

description. It is a very lively-looking little rose, whose bloom is
rather short in duration, but of quick succession, introduced to this
country in the year 1773. Our drawing was made from plants in the
nursery of Messrs. Loddige.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

Centifolia, in which may be included many of the French and Dutch Roses,
whose general appearance is so nearly alike, that when out of bloom it
would be very difficult to distinguish one from the other. For what
reason it has acquired the specific title of centifolia we are at a loss
to guess, as it would be utterly impossible to find out a species by any
given number of leaves, which must ever depend on the size of the plant.
But as a very old species long usage has given it such a sanction, that
a more appropriate title would not be used in preference.</p>

double-flowered velvet Roses, easily distinguished when in flower, but

found it on his premises in the year 1786, growing luxuriantly in the
midst of a hedge of single Sweetbriars. Its growth is so rapid, that it
will form shoots of seven and eight feet in one season; which joined to
the largeness of its flowers and foliage, induced us to adopt the
specific appellation of major, a title by which we think it may (at
present) be distinguished from any other, as the largest Sweetbriar we
have as yet seen is certainly altogether in size a minor, when compared
with this fine plant. Seeds, but not freely, and is propagated (slowly)
by layers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span></p>

with the Eglanteria major; and although found vegetating at the same
time, and under the same auspices, yet is its character altogether very
different; this being as slow in growth as the other is quick. It is the
only Eglantine Rose at present known with perfectly double flowers, and
is with difficulty increased by layers, which are a long time in forming
a root; and the seeds, which it very rarely ripens, remain in the ground

nurseryman, of Little Chelsea. It is as yet so little known, that a
dwarf variety of the Province is frequently sold for it; a mistake most
probably owing to its being commonly called amongst cultivators
Shailer’s Province Rose: but it certainly bears most resemblance to the
Rosa Indica, and is, as far as we can understand, a hybrid production
between the two species; and if so, it might come under the description
of variety only. But, whilst nature produces such distinct and beautiful
varieties, specific titles can only be regarded as a variation of terms.
It makes a most graceful appearance, from the drooping of its branches
and nodding of its flowers, whose close and numerous petals are too
heavy for its weak and slender stem to support. It appears to be a Rose
calculated to train against a trellis to great advantage. It is as hardy
as most Roses, and is increased (but not easily) by layers. Flowers
during the months of June and July.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span></p>

the description accords exactly with our figure. It is well known to
cultivators by the specific appellation of ferox,&mdash;we have therefore
retained it; although hystrix would have been a much better specific
title, as it seems by nature formed to be admired at a distance, from
the numerous large thorns with which the stem is surrounded, that appear
calculated to express the old adage of ‘Noli me tangere.’</p>

Thornless White Rose,&mdash;an appellation certainly not very descriptive of
the plant; for, although it is thornless on the upper part, yet at the
base of the stem it is thorny. The flowers are sometimes white, but we
have oftener seen them tinged with a pale pinky colour. In size and
shape they are like the Burgundy Rose, and in the foliage they resemble
the Rosa moschata, but are very distinct from either, and altogether
very different from any species with which we are at present acquainted.
It is slow of increase, as are all the distinctly new Roses we have
hitherto met with, which probably is (for a time) a genuine trait of
their originality. Our figure is from a plant in the nursery of Messrs.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
